          Toronto Robots is a daily robot news and review site for Canadians who care about
          the future of robotics — whether you&apos;re a researcher, enthusiast, or just curious
          about what&apos;s coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every morning, our AI editor scans the world&apos;s robot news and writes one great
          article about the most important story of the day. No filler. No aggregation. Just
          one well-written piece that matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also publish robot reviews and a buying guide to help Torontonians figure out
          which robot is right for them.
